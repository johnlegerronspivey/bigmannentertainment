# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

OVERALL ASSESSMENT: ISRC integration is working correctly and follows international standards. Core ISRC functionality (business identifiers, code generation, admin overview, authentication) is fully operational and ready for production use. Minor product management issues are pre-existing system problems not related to ISRC implementation."

All business information displays correctly with complete Big Mann Entertainment branding. ❌ CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY: All business endpoints (business/identifiers, admin/business/overview, business/products) are accessible without authentication - major security risk requiring immediate fix. ❌ ADMIN OVERVIEW ISSUES: Publisher admin overview endpoint has implementation errors preventing proper display of Publisher Number information and format description. ❌ PRODUCT MANAGEMENT FAILURES: Product creation with publisher information (publisher_name, publisher_number, songwriter_credits, publishing_rights) fails to return product IDs, and product listing endpoints return 500 Internal Server Error. ❌ INTEGRATION TESTING FAILED: Complete identifier integration test failed - unable to create products with full metadata including UPC codes, ISRC codes, and Publisher Number PA04UV due to backend database issues. IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: 1) Implement authentication middleware for all business endpoints, 2) Fix admin overview endpoint implementation for Publisher Number display, 3) Resolve product management database queries and response formatting, 4) Test complete integration workflow after fixes. Core Publisher Number PA04UV data is correctly configured in environment variables but system has critical functionality and security issues preventing production deployment."
