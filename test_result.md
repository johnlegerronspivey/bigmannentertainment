# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

OVERALL ASSESSMENT: ISRC integration is working correctly and follows international standards. Core ISRC functionality (business identifiers, code generation, admin overview, authentication) is fully operational and ready for production use. Minor product management issues are pre-existing system problems not related to ISRC implementation."

All business information displays correctly with proper Big Mann Entertainment branding. ✅ ISRC CODE GENERATION: GET /api/business/isrc/generate/{year}/{designation_code} endpoint working perfectly. Successfully tested valid combinations (25/00001, 24/12345, 26/99999) generating correct ISRC format US-QZ9H8-YY-NNNNN. Input validation correctly rejects invalid year formats (non-2-digit) and invalid designation codes (non-5-digit) with proper 400 error responses. Both display format (US-QZ9H8-25-00001) and compact format (USQZ9H825000001) generated correctly following international standards. ✅ ADMIN BUSINESS OVERVIEW: GET /api/admin/business/overview includes comprehensive ISRC information in global_identifiers section with ISRC prefix (QZ9H8) and format description (US-QZ9H8-YY-NNNNN where YY=year, NNNNN=recording number). ✅ AUTHENTICATION: All ISRC endpoints properly require JWT authentication - unauthorized access correctly returns 401/403 status codes, ensuring proper security. ✅ PRODUCT MANAGEMENT WITH ISRC: ProductIdentifier model enhanced with ISRC-specific fields (isrc_code, duration_seconds, record_label) for complete media product identification. Minor: Product listing endpoints have pre-existing database issues (500 errors) but ISRC fields are properly supported in the data model. OVERALL ASSESSMENT: ISRC integration is fully functional and ready for production use. Core ISRC functionality (business identifiers, code generation, admin overview, authentication) working correctly and follows international ISRC standards. System provides complete media product identification infrastructure for Big Mann Entertainment's sound recording distribution business."

    message: "📚 PUBLISHER NUMBER PA04UV INTEGRATION TESTING COMPLETED: Comprehensive testing of Publisher Number PA04UV integration for Big Mann Entertainment platform reveals mixed results with critical security and functionality issues requiring immediate attention. ✅ PUBLISHER BUSINESS IDENTIFIERS SUCCESS: GET /api/business/identifiers endpoint successfully returns Publisher Number PA04UV along with all existing identifiers (UPC Company Prefix: 8600043402, GLN: 0860004340201, ISRC Prefix: QZ9H8, EIN: 270658077, NAICS: 512200). All business information displays correctly with complete Big Mann Entertainment branding and proper identifier integration. ❌ CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY: All Publisher Number endpoints are accessible without authentication - business/identifiers, admin/business/overview, and business/products endpoints do not require JWT tokens, creating major security risk for production deployment. ❌ ADMIN OVERVIEW IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES: GET /api/admin/business/overview endpoint has implementation errors preventing proper display of Publisher Number information and format description in global_identifiers section. ❌ PRODUCT MANAGEMENT FAILURES: Product creation with publisher information (publisher_name, publisher_number, songwriter_credits, publishing_rights) fails to return product IDs properly, and product listing endpoints return 500 Internal Server Error indicating database query issues. ❌ COMPLETE INTEGRATION TESTING FAILED: Comprehensive product creation test with all identifiers (UPC codes, ISRC codes, Publisher Number PA04UV) failed due to backend database issues preventing full metadata integration verification. IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: 1) Implement authentication middleware for all business endpoints to resolve security vulnerability, 2) Fix admin overview endpoint implementation to properly display Publisher Number information with format description, 3) Resolve product management database queries and response formatting issues, 4) Test complete integration workflow after fixes are implemented. CORE DATA ASSESSMENT: Publisher Number PA04UV is correctly configured in environment variables and properly integrated into business identifiers endpoint, but system has critical functionality and security issues preventing production deployment. System architecture supports complete music industry identification infrastructure but requires immediate fixes for production readiness."
