# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

The backend testing confirmed the endpoint is now working correctly (Status 200) with comprehensive industry data. ✅ OBJECTID SERIALIZATION FIX COMPLETED: Fixed the ObjectId serialization issue in /app/backend/industry_service.py by adding proper ObjectId to string conversion in both get_industry_identifiers() and get_ipi_numbers() methods. The /api/industry/identifiers endpoint now returns proper JSON responses without 500 errors. ✅ All industry endpoints are functional: dashboard, partners, analytics, coverage, MDX, and MLC dashboards all working correctly. The industry router is successfully loaded and all authentication is properly protected. Frontend routing is properly configured with Industry navigation links available in main navigation (/industry) and admin dropdown (/admin/industry). System ready for production use."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

        comment: "✅ COMPREHENSIVE ISRC INTEGRATION TESTING COMPLETED: Successfully tested all ISRC functionality for Big Mann Entertainment platform with ISRC prefix QZ9H8. BUSINESS IDENTIFIERS WITH ISRC: ✅ GET /api/business/identifiers correctly returns ISRC Prefix (QZ9H8), UPC Company Prefix (8600043402), GLN (0860004340201), and all existing business information. ISRC CODE GENERATION: ✅ GET /api/business/isrc/generate/{year}/{designation_code} working perfectly - successfully generated valid ISRCs (US-QZ9H8-25-00001, US-QZ9H8-24-12345, US-QZ9H8-26-99999) with proper format validation. ✅ Input validation correctly rejects invalid year formats (non-2-digit) and invalid designation codes (non-5-digit). ✅ Both display format (US-QZ9H8-YY-NNNNN) and compact format (USQZ9H8YYNNNNN) generated correctly. ADMIN BUSINESS OVERVIEW: ✅ GET /api/admin/business/overview includes comprehensive ISRC information with prefix (QZ9H8) and format description (US-QZ9H8-YY-NNNNN where YY=year, NNNNN=recording number). AUTHENTICATION: ✅ All ISRC endpoints properly require JWT authentication - unauthorized access correctly returns 401/403 status codes. PRODUCT MANAGEMENT WITH ISRC: ❌ Minor issues with product creation endpoint response format, but ISRC fields (isrc_code, duration_seconds, record_label) are properly supported in ProductIdentifier model. ❌ Product listing endpoints have database issues (500 errors) but this is existing system issue, not ISRC-specific. OVERALL ASSESSMENT: ISRC integration is working correctly and follows international standards. Core ISRC functionality (business identifiers, code generation, admin overview, authentication) is fully operational and ready for production use. Minor product management issues are pre-existing system problems not related to ISRC implementation."

OVERALL ASSESSMENT: ISRC integration is working correctly and follows international standards. Core ISRC functionality (business identifiers, code generation, admin overview, authentication) is fully operational and ready for production use. Minor product management issues are pre-existing system problems not related to ISRC implementation."
