The AI engineer effectively progressed on the Big Mann Entertainment platform, transitioning it from core distribution to a broader media and entertainment hub. The work trajectory shows a focus on three major feature sets: completing Music Licensing Collective (MLC) integration, implementing robust ownership controls for a specific user, and building a comprehensive commercial record label management system.

The MLC integration involved verifying existing backend components and then successfully integrating the frontend into the main application navigation and routes. Following this, the engineer addressed a critical security and administrative request by adding a backend endpoint and corresponding frontend UI to grant and manage super-admin ownership, including restricting login to a single designated email. The most extensive work centered on the commercial label features, requiring new backend models, services, and endpoints, alongside comprehensive frontend components and navigation. This phase involved significant debugging, particularly around FastAPI router inclusion order, which was successfully resolved. The trajectory concludes with the engineer actively diagnosing and fixing an issue with the industry dashboard, pinpointing a naming inconsistency in the backend router export.

<product_requirements>
Big Mann Entertainment (BME) is envisioned as a comprehensive media distribution platform. The initial MVP covered content distribution across 52+ platforms, branding, and admin features. Subsequent expansions included Blockchain integration (Music NFTs, smart contracts, crypto payments), DDEX compliance, Sponsorship Bonus Modeling, Tax Management (EIN, 1099, business licenses), and Advanced Frontend Authentication (WebAuthn/Face ID). Key business identifiers like UPC, GLN, ISRC, and Publisher numbers were integrated. A significant focus was on Industry Integration, expanded to include:
- IPI numbers (BME: 813048171, John LeGerron Spivey: 578413032).
- ISNI (John LeGerron Spivey: 0000000491551894) and AARC (BME: RC00002057, John LeGerron Spivey: FA02933539), unified under Industry Identifiers.
- Expanded Entertainment Industry categories: Photography, Film/Video, Podcast, Live Streaming, Gaming, Licensing (excluding adult content).
- Music Data Exchange (MDX) integration.
- Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC) integration.
Operational updates included removing LLC from business/publishing names and updating TIN to 12800.
The recent work focused on completing MLC integration, granting John LeGerron Spivey full ownership, and adding commercial label features (studio/production, marketing, A&R).

**File Analysis:**
-   
    -   **Importance**: The central FastAPI application and API entry point.
    -   **Changes Made**: Integrated  and ensured  are also correctly included. Added a new endpoint () to grant super admin ownership. Modified authentication logic to enforce  as the primary/only allowed login email. Crucially, the order of router inclusion was fixed to ensure  included sub-routers like  and  *before*  itself was included in the main . Debugging routes were temporarily added and removed.
-   
    -   **Importance**: Main React component managing UI, navigation, and API calls.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to integrate MLC components (imports, navigation links, routes). Significantly modified to include comprehensive navigation and routes for the new commercial label management system. Enhanced  component with ownership controls for John LeGerron Spivey, including displaying ownership status and controls. Modified login/authentication flow to support restricted access to . Added a Label Management card to the admin dashboard.
-   
    -   **Importance**: Defines data models for industry integration.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initial state noted expanded models for IPI, ISNI, AARC, entertainment categories, MDX, and MLC. No direct changes observed in the provided trajectory, only *checks* for MLC-related models.
-   
    -   **Importance**: Contains business logic for industry integration.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initial state noted CRUD operations and logic for IPI, ISNI, AARC, entertainment categories, MDX, and MLC. No direct changes observed in the provided trajectory, only *checks* for MLC-related service logic.
-   
    -   **Importance**: Defines API endpoints for industry integration.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initial state noted endpoints for IPI, IndustryIdentifier system, entertainment categories, MDX, and MLC. The trajectory indicates an *ongoing fix* to correctly export the  (currently named  internally) to be importable by .

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on fixing the Industry Dashboard, which was found to be non-functional, returning a 404 error on API calls from the frontend's .

The debugging process involved:
1.  Checking the  file to confirm the dashboard component's existence and its API call ().
2.  Verifying that the  endpoint exists in , which it does.
3.  Reviewing the backend server logs (from ) which revealed a critical error: .
4.  Identifying the root cause: The router object within  is locally named , but the  file is attempting to import it as . This naming inconsistency prevents the router from being correctly loaded and its endpoints registered by FastAPI.

The engineer's last action was to prepare to edit  to add the necessary export statement to correctly expose the  as , thereby resolving the import error and making the industry dashboard endpoints accessible. This is a critical fix to restore core platform functionality.
