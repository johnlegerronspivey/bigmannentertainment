The AI engineer's work trajectory showcases an impressive evolution of the Big Mann Entertainment media platform, from an MVP to a feature-rich complete media distribution empire. The initial phase involved expanding content distribution capabilities (33+ to 52+ platforms including PROs and FM broadcast), establishing branding, and laying foundational administrative features. Subsequent iterative development focused on complex system integrations: DDEX compliance for metadata, initial blockchain integration for Music NFTs, a comprehensive sponsorship bonus modeling system, and an elaborate tax management system. The engineer adeptly navigated full-stack development, creating backend models/services/endpoints and corresponding React frontend components, while ensuring proper environment variable usage and adhering to Kubernetes ingress rules. The work consistently involved detailed file modifications, dependency management, and thorough backend and frontend testing. The current immediate task involves implementing advanced frontend authentication with Face ID, for which integration playbooks have just been acquired.

<product_requirements>
The overarching goal was to build a robust media distribution platform for Big Mann Entertainment (BME). Initially focused on core distribution to 33+ general platforms, the scope expanded significantly. Key features required:

*   **Expanded Distribution**: Coverage for 37+ platforms with PROs (SoundExchange, ASCAP, BMI, SESAC) for royalty management, and further to 52+ platforms with traditional FM broadcast networks.
*   **Branding**: Integration of Big Mann Entertainment logo across UI.
*   **Blockchain Integration**: Implementation of Music NFTs, smart contracts, crypto payments, and decentralized content ownership, using a specified Ethereum contract address.
*   **Administrator Features**: A comprehensive admin interface for platform management (user/content).
*   **DDEX Compliance**: Adherence to Digital Data Exchange standards for music metadata exchange.
*   **Sponsorship Bonus Modeling**: A system for sponsor management, performance tracking, and automated bonus calculations.
*   **Tax Management**: Integration of Employer Identification Number (EIN), 1099 generation, tax reporting, and compliance tracking. This expanded to include comprehensive business license information (address, city, state), Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), NAICS code (Sound Recording Industries - 512200), and business contact details.
*   **Advanced Frontend Authentication**: Implementation of registration and login with Face ID.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was tasked with implementing a comprehensive frontend authentication system for the Big Mann Entertainment platform. This system is required to support user registration, login functionalities, and an advanced Face ID integration method.

The current state of work is as follows:
1.  **User Request and Clarification**: The user explicitly requested to add front end authentication registration and log in with face id. Upon querying for further details, the user responded with do all, indicating a comprehensive implementation of the requested features.
2.  **Integration Playbook Acquisition**: The AI engineer's most recent action was to initiate the process of obtaining necessary integration playbooks for the advanced authentication technologies. This involved calling a sub-agent to get playbooks specifically for WebAuthn and Face Recognition, which are critical for building the Face ID login and secure registration.

The backend infrastructure and current frontend components do not yet reflect these authentication features. The system is paused at the point of having gathered the technical blueprints (playbooks) required to proceed with the actual coding and integration of the new authentication mechanism. The foundation for this complex feature is being laid by understanding the necessary third-party integrations.
