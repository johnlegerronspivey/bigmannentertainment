The previous AI engineer successfully handled several critical tasks to enhance and stabilize the Big Mann Entertainment platform. Initially, the core task was to remove WebAuthn (Face ID) authentication, which involved systematically deleting backend endpoints, modifying , and refactoring frontend components in . Following this, the engineer addressed a user-reported bug with password reset functionality, identifying and fixing incomplete backend logic and missing email configurations. This led to implementing a robust email service, including welcome emails and a functional password reset system using .

The most recent phase focused on a comprehensive bug-fixing initiative. Initial testing revealed numerous 404 errors for backend endpoints, UPC/ISRC validation issues, missing modules, and frontend UI problems. The engineer systematically added missing basic endpoints, corrected mobile navigation, implemented a 404 page, and critically, fixed URL routing issues by adjusting  prefixes in multiple backend module files (e.g., , ). The work concluded while implementing the remaining missing endpoints for modules like Payment, Label, and Sponsorship to achieve 100% functionality.

<product_requirements>
Big Mann Entertainment (BME) aims to be a full-spectrum media distribution platform, supporting content distribution, admin controls, blockchain integration (NFTs, crypto payments), DDEX compliance, sponsorship, tax management, and WebAuthn authentication. It manages key business identifiers (UPC, GLN, ISRC) and integrates with industry standards (IPI, ISNI, AARC, MDX, MLC, GS1). Recent updates included full MLC integration, super-admin setup, and a commercial label management system. The platform distributes across 91 channels. Key features developed include an enhanced licensing system with statutory rate calculations and daily compensation, and GS1 US integration. The previous engineer was tasked with ongoing development, including removing Face ID, fixing a broken password reset, implementing email notifications, and ultimately achieving 100% functionality by resolving all errors, broken dashboards, and inaccurate actions across the application.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on fixing URL routing for specialized modules and implementing missing endpoints to achieve 100% application functionality. Comprehensive backend and frontend testing had previously revealed numerous 404 errors, UPC/ISRC validation issues, missing module endpoints (Tax, Label, Payment, GS1, etc.), and frontend UI problems like a broken mobile navigation and lack of 404 page handling.

The engineer systematically addressed these by:
1.  **Frontend Fixes**: Rectifying the mobile navigation menu, creating and integrating a  component for 404 error handling, and improving placeholder components in .
2.  **Backend Router Prefix Corrections**: A critical set of fixes involved adjusting the  prefixes in backend module files. For instance, 's prefix was changed from  to ,  received a  prefix, and similar corrections were applied to , , , , and . These changes resolved numerous 404 errors by ensuring proper routing through the Kubernetes ingress (which already handles the  prefix).
3.  **Endpoint Implementation**: The engineer began implementing the *remaining* missing endpoints for specific modules. This involved adding , , and  to ;  and  to ; and  and  to .

The current work left off just as the engineer was about to add missing DDEX endpoints, with the goal of bringing all 63 expected endpoints to full functionality. Backend testing confirmed a significant improvement to 66.7% platform functionality after the router prefix fixes, but the remaining 18 endpoints still needed to be implemented.
