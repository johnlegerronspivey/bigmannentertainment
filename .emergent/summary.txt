The AI engineer effectively continued the development of the Big Mann Entertainment platform, expanding its capabilities from core distribution to a comprehensive media and entertainment hub. The work primarily focused on integrating various industry identifiers and expanding content categories. Initial efforts centered on implementing IPI numbers, followed by a broader Industry Identifiers system to include ISNI and AARC, which enhanced data management and UI. The engineer also addressed operational requests, such as removing LLC from business names and updating the TIN. A significant expansion involved integrating diverse entertainment categories (e.g., photography, video, gaming), demonstrating a robust ability to extend the platform's core industry integration. More recently, the focus has been on specific music industry integrations, with MDX successfully implemented and MLC integration currently underway. The process involved full-stack changes, from backend models and services to frontend components and navigation.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on integrating the Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC) into the Big Mann Entertainment platform. The last user request related to this was Connect Mechanical Licensing Collective to the app.

The engineer has already started the backend implementation for MLC:
*    was updated to include MLC-related data models (Chat 253-254).
*    was updated to include business logic for MLC (Chat 255-258).
*    was updated to expose API endpoints for MLC functionality (Chat 259-262).

The current task, as indicated by the last action (Chat 263), is to create the comprehensive frontend component for MLC integration in . This is the immediate next step in completing the MLC integration, following the pattern of previous feature additions (IPI, ISNI/AARC, expanded entertainment categories, MDX) which involved coordinated backend and frontend development and subsequent testing.
