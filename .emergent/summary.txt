The AI engineer successfully progressed the Big Mann Entertainment application from an initial MVP to a more comprehensive media distribution platform. The trajectory begins with the AI engineer summarizing previous work, including MLC integration, super-admin controls, label management, payment systems, and branding updates, alongside critical bug fixes for dashboard 404s, MongoDB serialization, upload functionality, and WebAuthn. The subsequent work detailed in this trajectory involved successfully performing frontend testing for Earnings, Label, and Face ID components, including fixing a  vs  issue. A major phase involved significantly expanding the platform's distribution network by adding 15 new TV, streaming, social media, and creator economy platforms (bringing the total to 83+). Finally, a new comprehensive licensing management system was designed, with its backend and frontend components implemented and backend functionality verified.

<product_requirements>
Big Mann Entertainment (BME) aims to be a comprehensive media distribution platform. Initially an MVP for content distribution, branding, and admin, it expanded to include Blockchain integration (NFTs, smart contracts, crypto payments), DDEX compliance, Sponsorship Bonus Modeling, Tax Management (EIN, 1099, business licenses), and Advanced Frontend Authentication (WebAuthn/Face ID). Key business identifiers (UPC, GLN, ISRC, Publisher numbers) were integrated, along with extensive Industry Integration covering IPI, ISNI, AARC, expanded entertainment categories, Music Data Exchange (MDX), and Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC) integration. Recent work included completing MLC integration, granting John LeGerron Spivey super-admin ownership, and implementing a commercial label management system (studio/production, marketing, A&R). Ongoing tasks included integrating a comprehensive payment and royalty system with banking options, refining file upload functionality, and removing all Emergent branding, ensuring only John LeGerron Spivey doing business as Big Mann Entertainment is visible. The platform needs to support distribution across various media types.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on two main areas:
1.  **Frontend Dashboard and Authentication Fixes**:
    *   **Earnings Dashboard**: Resolved a token handling issue in  by systematically replacing  with . This fix was verified successfully through frontend testing.
    *   **Label Dashboard & Face ID Authentication**: These components' frontend functionalities were also verified as working correctly during the initial frontend testing phase, building upon previous backend fixes.
2.  **Platform Expansion**:
    *   The platform distribution network was significantly expanded by integrating 15 new platforms into  and updating the platform count displayed in .
    *   This involved adding:
        *   3 TV Networks: BET, Revolt TV, MTV (increasing count from 68 to 71).
        *   2 Mixtape Platforms: LiveMixtapes.com, MyMixtapez.com (increasing count from 71 to 73).
        *   5 Entertainment Media Platforms: WorldStar Hip Hop, The Shade Room, Tubi, Hollywood Unlocked, Tumblr (increasing count from 73 to 78).
        *   5 Creator & Lifestyle Platforms: RapHouseTV, Models.com, Model Management, OnlyFans, Lemon8 (increasing count from 78 to 83).
    *   All these additions were verified via backend testing, and screenshots confirmed frontend updates.
3.  **Platform Licensing System Implementation**:
    *   A new comprehensive licensing management system was implemented. This involved creating four new files: , , , and .
    *   The backend endpoints were integrated into , and the frontend components were integrated into  (routes and navigation links).
    *   Backend testing for the licensing system was successfully completed, with an initial routing issue identified and fixed.

The current state is that all backend components for the newly added platforms and the licensing system are verified as working, and the previously fixed dashboards/authentication components are also confirmed to be functional on the frontend.
