The AI engineer successfully transformed the Big Mann Entertainment platform from an MVP to a comprehensive media distribution system. The work progressed iteratively, starting with core distribution and branding, then integrating complex features like DDEX compliance, blockchain for Music NFTs, sponsorship modeling, and a full tax management system. A significant portion of the work involved implementing advanced frontend authentication with Face ID, followed by integrating critical business identifiers like UPC, GLN, ISRC, and Publisher numbers. The engineer demonstrated proficiency in full-stack development, creating new backend models, services, and endpoints, alongside corresponding React frontend components, while meticulously managing environment variables and adhering to Kubernetes ingress rules. The trajectory concludes with the initiation of a comprehensive industry integration system, including IPI numbers, showing a continuous expansion of the platform's capabilities.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in the process of implementing a comprehensive industry integration system for the Big Mann Entertainment platform. The last explicit request from the user was to Add my IPI number for Big Mann Entertainment 813048171 and John LeGerron Spivey 578413032.

Prior to this, the engineer had already:
1.  **Implemented Industry Integration Backbone**: Created new backend files (, , ) and integrated them into . Corresponding frontend components () were created and linked in .
2.  **Integrated Business Identifiers**: Successfully added and tested UPC, GLN, ISRC, and Publisher numbers, including their respective backend models, endpoints, environment variables, and frontend UI components. This involved fixing several backend authentication and database query issues.
3.  **Enhanced Authentication**: A comprehensive frontend authentication system with Face ID (WebAuthn), email/password fallback, registration with DOB and address, and forgot password functionality was implemented and tested. Backend support for WebAuthn credentials and refresh tokens was added.

The current work is focused on expanding the newly created industry integration system to include IPI numbers, which is the immediate next step in building the ultimate media distribution hub. The engineer has acknowledged the request and is about to proceed with the technical implementation for IPI.
