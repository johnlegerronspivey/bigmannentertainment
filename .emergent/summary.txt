The AI engineer successfully enhanced the Big Mann Entertainment platform, progressing from an MVP to a more robust media distribution system. Initially, the engineer summarized prior work on MLC, admin controls, label management, payments, and branding, alongside crucial bug fixes. The trajectory then details successful frontend testing for Earnings, Label, and Face ID components, including a fix for  vs . A significant expansion of the distribution network was achieved by integrating 15 new platforms, bringing the total to 83+. A comprehensive licensing management system was designed and implemented, with backend functionality verified. Following user requests, the licensing system was enhanced to support statutory rates and daily compensation, including backend model, service, and endpoint updates, and corresponding frontend UI modifications. Both backend and frontend testing confirmed these new features. Finally, the AI engineer implemented GS1 US integration, creating new backend models, services, and endpoints, and developing a frontend component, integrating it into the application's navigation and routing, which was also thoroughly tested. The work consistently involved updating  and asking for user confirmation before frontend testing.

<product_requirements>
Big Mann Entertainment (BME) aims to be a complete media distribution platform. Starting as an MVP for content distribution and admin, it evolved to integrate Blockchain (NFTs, crypto payments), DDEX compliance, Sponsorship Modeling, Tax Management, and WebAuthn authentication. Key business identifiers (UPC, GLN, ISRC) were incorporated, along with extensive Industry Integration (IPI, ISNI, AARC, MDX, MLC). Recent efforts focused on completing MLC integration, establishing John LeGerron Spivey as super-admin, and developing a commercial label management system. Ongoing goals include a comprehensive payment/royalty system, refined file uploads, and removal of all Emergent branding. The platform now supports 83+ distribution channels across TV, streaming, social media, and creator platforms. New additions include a comprehensive licensing management system with statutory rate calculations and daily compensation payouts, and GS1 US integration for business information management.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed two major feature implementations:
1.  **Platform Licensing System Enhancements**: The existing licensing system was extended to incorporate statutory rates and daily compensation payments. This involved:
    *   **Backend**: Updating  with  and  schemas. Modifying  to include functions for , , and , ensuring Big Mann Entertainment receives a 10% commission. New API endpoints were added to  for these features.
    *   **Frontend**:  was updated to display and manage these new features, including the addition of new UI tabs for statutory rates and daily compensation.
    *   **Testing**: Both backend and frontend testing of these new licensing features were successfully completed. Screenshot verification confirmed the system's proper functionality and security (redirection to login if unauthenticated).
2.  **GS1 US Integration**: A new integration with GS1 US was implemented to manage business information. This involved:
    *   **Backend**: Creation of new files:  (for data structure),  (for business logic), and  (for API endpoints). These new endpoints were integrated into the main  file, and necessary environment variables were added to .
    *   **Frontend**: A new  file was created for the UI. This component was then integrated into  by adding imports, navigation links (both desktop and mobile), and routing.
    *   **Testing**: Backend and frontend testing for the GS1 integration were successfully completed, ensuring proper data flow and UI functionality.

The current state is that the Big Mann Entertainment platform has enhanced licensing capabilities with statutory rates and daily payouts, and a fully integrated GS1 US business information system, all verified through comprehensive testing.
