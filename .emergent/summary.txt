The AI engineer successfully progressed the Big Mann Entertainment platform from MVP to a comprehensive media distribution system. Initially, the engineer summarized existing features and resolved critical bugs related to frontend authentication ( vs ). A significant phase involved expanding the distribution network by integrating 15 new platforms, totaling 83+, and implementing a robust licensing management system with backend and frontend enhancements for statutory rates and daily compensation. Following this, GS1 US integration was completed, involving new backend models, services, and frontend components. Most recently, the engineer addressed user-reported bugs, successfully identifying and fixing a critical mathematical error in the UPC generation algorithm () and rectifying frontend platform count discrepancies (), bringing the total platforms to 91. All implementations were thoroughly tested, and  was consistently updated.

<product_requirements>
Big Mann Entertainment (BME) is envisioned as a comprehensive media distribution platform. It has evolved from an MVP to include content distribution, admin controls, blockchain integration (NFTs, crypto payments), DDEX compliance, sponsorship modeling, tax management, and WebAuthn authentication. Key business identifiers (UPC, GLN, ISRC) and extensive industry integrations (IPI, ISNI, AARC, MDX, MLC) are central. Recent development included full MLC integration, super-admin John LeGerron Spivey setup, and a commercial label management system. Ongoing goals encompass a complete payment/royalty system and refined file uploads. The platform currently supports 91 distribution channels across TV, streaming, social media, and creator platforms. Newly implemented features include an enhanced licensing management system with statutory rate calculations and daily compensation payouts, and GS1 US integration for business information management. The platform is now declared 100% functional with all critical bugs resolved.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed a comprehensive bug-fixing phase, addressing all identified issues to ensure the Big Mann Entertainment app is 100% functional. This work followed the successful integration of 7 new distribution platforms and the GS1 US system.

The key work performed in this final phase includes:
1.  **UPC Generation Algorithm Bug Fix**: A critical mathematical error in the UPC-A check digit calculation within  was identified and corrected. The logic was changed from  to the correct , ensuring valid UPC codes are generated.
2.  **Platform Count Consistency Fix**: Discrepancies in the displayed platform count on the frontend were resolved. All instances showing 83 platforms were updated to 90+ platforms in  and other relevant UI elements, accurately reflecting the recently expanded distribution network of 91 total platforms.
3.  **Comprehensive Testing and Verification**: Both backend and frontend systems underwent thorough testing. Backend tests confirmed the UPC fix and overall system functionality (business identifiers, product management, authentication, database integration, distribution platform accessibility). Frontend tests verified correct UI display, WebAuthn functionality, secure routes, and responsive design, ensuring no critical errors or performance issues.

The platform is now declared production-ready, with all critical bugs resolved, comprehensive security verified, full feature coverage, and an expanded network of 91 distribution platforms.
